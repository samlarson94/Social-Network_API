# Social-Network_API

## Description
This app works as an API for a social network application that allows users to share thoughts, react to those of their friends, and build a friend list.

The app uses Express.js for routing, MongoDB for a database, and Mongoose as an ODM.

## Instructions
To use this application, clone the repo to your system and then run an "npm install" command in your terminal.  It requires Express and Mongoose to be installed, so make sure to run "npm i express" and "npm i mongoose" as well. 

## Usage
Once the repo has been cloned and all dependencies have been installed. You can launch the application by running a "nodemon server.js" command.

Once operational, open up Insomnia, Postman, or another API design platform of your choosing to start interacting with the data using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE commands.  See the comments in each Routes.js file for specific endpoints.

## Future Development
After debugging has been completed on the backend, it would be interesting to start building out a front-end for this app. Homeroutes and a basic user interface is where I would like to start when I have time.
